This is a bug report.

The html file should contains 3 pages.

When enabling accessibility by 

```
   builder.usePdfUaAccessbility(true);
   builder.usePdfAConformance(PdfRendererBuilder.PdfAConformance.PDFA_1_A);
```

The 3rd page in the PDF is blank.

The junit test
`` com.openhtmltopdf.pdfboxout.test.Html2PdfTest `` contains 2 methods:
One with accessibility enabled, the other one is regular.

The generated PDF will be in "``temp/pdf``" folder.

After cloning the code, you can run it by ``mvn test``.

``openhtmltopdf-pdfbox`` version ``1.0.6 `` is relatively better.
The PDF files generated by all the higher versions up to ``1.0.10`` have more accessibility errors when checked with Adobe Acrobat DC.
